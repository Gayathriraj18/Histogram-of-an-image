# Histogram and Histogram Equalization of an image
## Aim
To obtain a histogram for finding the frequency of pixels in an Image with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255. Also write the code using OpenCV to perform histogram equalization.

## Software Required:
Anaconda - Python 3.7

## Algorithm:
### Step1:
Import the necessary libraries and read two images, Color image and Gray Scale image.

# Step2:
Calculate the Histogram of Gray scale image and each channel of the color image.

# Step3:
Display the histograms with their respective images.

# Step4:
Equalize the grayscale image.

# Step5:
Display the grayscale image.

## Program:

```
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Write your code to find the histogram of gray scale image and color image channels.





# Display the histogram of gray scale image and any one channel histogram from color image





# Write the code to perform histogram equalization of the image. 







```
## Output:
### Input Grayscale Image and Color Image
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Histogram of Grayscale Image and any channel of Color Image
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Histogram Equalization of Grayscale Image
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Result: 
Thus the histogram for finding the frequency of pixels in an image with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255 is obtained. Also,histogram equalization is done for the gray scale image using OpenCV.
